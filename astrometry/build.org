As of April 2019, the script doc/install_astrometry_on_linux.sh will install all dependencies along with astrometry.net on Linux, and download 4200/ index files.

This script did not install the netpbm-dev or the wcslib-dev development packages. Both installed via synaptic.

make
make py
make extra
make install  # to put it in /usr/local/astrometry
# or:
make install INSTALL_DIR=/some/other/place
